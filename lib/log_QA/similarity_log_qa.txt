Why Self-Attention?

CONTENT: 
 Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].

End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence- aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].

To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence- aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].

What is the LoRA?

SOURCE_0: .\lib\SOURCE_DOCUMENTS\Easily Train a Specialized LLM.docx
CONTENT: 
 An ecosystem. LoRA is a practically useful tool that gives (almost) anyone the power to train a specialized LLM over their data. As a result, LoRA has been widely studied within the AI research community, leading to a variety of extensions, alternatives, and practical tools to go along with it. One of the most notable extensions is QLoRa, which combines LoRA with model quantization to further reduce the memory overhead of LLM fnetuning. However, this reduction in memory overhead comes at the cost of a slight decrease in training speed.
